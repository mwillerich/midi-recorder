Midi Recorder
=============
This is a collection of scripts that allow you to record MIDI messages sent from devices to your machine, and replay them at a later point.

I've created them so that I can test the mapping of my MIDI controller for the [MIXXX DJ software](http://www.mixxx.org).

Dependencies
------------
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4.x or higher
  - midi (npm module)
  - log (npm module)

How to run
----------

`node record.js` to record.

`node play.js` to replay.
